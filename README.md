# Bolt
A 2D Unity framework / utility collection, built on top of Unity 5

`Bolt` is the development framework used by us at Voltic, it's more-or-less a suite of helper utilities that speed up common tasks.

`Bolt` is currently pre-alpha and is not in use in an active project, development is planned to pick up pace during 2016 at which point documentation and examples will be provided.

# Dependencies

`Bolt` depends on `SimpleJson` (https://github.com/facebook-csharp-sdk/simple-json, included in the repo) and `GoKit` (https://github.com/prime31/GoKit). I intend to make the dependency on `GoKit` optional in the future and provide the classes that use it as plugins.

# Recommendations

`UnityToolbag` (https://github.com/nickgravelyn/unitytoolbag) provides many useful utilities, and it's possible `Bolt` or its plugins will grow to depend on it in the future.
